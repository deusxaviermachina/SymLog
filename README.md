# SymLog
Mathematical Logic Parsing and Evaluation


Parses string input that contains the fundamental binary operators "AND", "XOR", "OR", "XNOR", "NAND",and "NOR" as well as the fundamental unary operators "P" and "~P" as zeroth order logic expressions.

Allows for construction and querying of a first order logic universe. This network of logical dependencies consists of relationships between subjects/premises and predicates/conclusions
