# SymLog (working title)
Mathematical Logic Parsing and Evaluation


Parses string input that contains the fundamental binary operators "AND", "XOR", and "OR" as well as the fundamental unary operators "P" and "~P" as zeroth order logic expressions.

Allows for construction and querying of a first order logic universe. This network of logical dependencies, which consists of relationships between subjects/premises and predicates/conclusions, has database-like functionality (in terms of its ability to define and store relationships between entities).
